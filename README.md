# as2-peppol-server

# This project continues on https://github.com/phax/as2-peppol

# Status migration AS2 &rarr; AS4

Peppol migrated to AS4 as the mandatory transport protocol as of February 1<sup>st</sup>, 2020.
The support of AS2 will be gracefully faded out.
Personally I wouldn't recommend to start new Peppol AS2 projects.

See **phase4** as an AS4 solution that can send and receive Peppol Messages: https://github.com/phax/phase4
